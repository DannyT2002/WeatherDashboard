# Weather Dashboard
## Project Description

This Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application that provides a 5-day weather forecast for any searched city. Users can view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with a 5-day forecast displayed side by side for easy comparison. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and localStorage to maintain a search history for quick access to previously searched cities.
